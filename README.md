# Tic-Tac-Toe-Minimax

---

A very simple game yet very difficult to implement, especially when trying to find the best heuristic
function for your decision-making AI.

I also tried to use the aplha-beta technique so that the program explores faster the nodes.

I think the code works correctly for the standard and the alpha-beta files.

You will also find the first attemp to learn cpp which is not perfected.
